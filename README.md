# Example Project

This project is to demonstrate a bug in the pact-js framework where an expected interaction that is not called does not fail the tests.
The interaction that should fail is [here](https://github.com/bbarke/pact-js-example/blob/master/client-spec.js#L187) on line 187

These example files are pulled from the [pact-js karma/jasmine](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/tree/master/karma/jasmine) exmaples.

### To run
